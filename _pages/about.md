I'm a GCP Data Engineer with over 3 years of experience in data engineering and analytics, specializing in Python, SQL, analytics and machine learning models. I enjoy working at the intersection of data, software and business decisions.

Some of my latest work includes implementing Rudderstack as a CDP, creating a Master Data Management (MDM) for both customer and product data, transitioning form Universal Analytics (UA) to GA4, designing a Price Optimization model with Machine Learning (ML) and leveraging cloud technologies for data pipeline (ETL) construction and optimization.

I'm proficient at technologies including Serverless Functions, Airflow, Spark, BigQuery, QlikSense BI, Kafka, and others.

I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from the Colorado School of Mines with certifications as a Scrum Master and have completed extensive coursework in data science, software engineering, and data engineering foundations.
